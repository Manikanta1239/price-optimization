# 📊 Price Optimization Analysis

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for analyzing and implementing price optimization strategies using Python, focusing on retail pricing and dynamic pricing models.

## 📝 Overview

The project implements two main pricing analysis approaches:
- Retail Price Optimization
- Dynamic Pricing Strategy

Each approach uses different datasets and machine learning techniques to predict and optimize pricing decisions.
