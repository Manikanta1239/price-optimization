# 📊 Price Optimization Analysis

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for analyzing and implementing price optimization strategies using Python, focusing on both **retail pricing** and **dynamic pricing** models.

---

## 📝 Overview

This project includes two core pricing approaches:

- **Retail Price Optimization**
- **Dynamic Pricing Strategy**

Each approach applies unique datasets and machine learning techniques to drive better pricing decisions in real-world scenarios.
